# üéâ Fun Calculator

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**‚Äîa cheerful and simple Python program to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers with style! üòé‚ú®

## Features

- **Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division** (with decimals!)
- Fun, friendly inline comments and emoji
- Interactive user prompts

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The program will ask you to enter two numbers (floats allowed for decimal precision).
2. **Calculations**: It instantly computes the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers you provide.
3. **Results**: Outputs all four results in a friendly, easy-to-read format.

## Usage

1. **Copy the code** into a Python file (e.g., `fun_calculator.py`).
2. **Run the script** with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to enter your two numbers.
4. **See your results!**

## Example

```text
Enter the first number: 13.4
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.4
Difference: 11.4
Product: 26.8
Quotient: 6.7
```

## Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Division by zero** is not checked in this script. If you enter zero as the second number, Python will raise an error!
- The code is intended for educational and entertainment purposes‚Äîfeel free to expand it!

## Customization Ideas

- Add input validation (avoid division by zero, non-numeric input)
- Allow repeated calculations in a loop
- Add more operations (power, modulo, etc.)

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è and Python!
